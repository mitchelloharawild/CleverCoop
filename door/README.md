# Coop door (the command center)

The coop door is much more than just an automatic door for your chickens. The door acts as the hub for all of the extension modules, which each can be plugged into the back of the door within the coop. The door also houses the microcontroller, which allows you to remotely connect to your coop.

The design is currently in development and is not yet tested.
